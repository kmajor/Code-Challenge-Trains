Write any notes you want to make here. For example, you might want to
tell us how to install any dependencies and run the program you've
written.

Game Plan:

Get Nokogiri to load a file

Parse said file

Figure out how to pull out the relevant bits POC stuffs

Setup testing framework, probably minitest

Put data into structures that will be useful for desired output

Write any methods required to do calculations for needed output

Refactor

Have a 2nd set of eyes quickly review for any obvious flaws

Refactor

Submit to Loco2

Get Job @ Loco2

Live long enough to write search algorithms for commercial space travel

Be buried on mars.

ReadMe:

This requires the following gems:

nokogiri (if you don't have nokogiri installed already, it's a fatty, sorry)

date

minitest

To execute just run:

ruby parser.rb

ruby tests.rb

For the record, this took me probably 2x as long as the alloted time
